# Intro-ML
CS 4375.003 - Introduction to Machine Learning - F22

## Overview of Machine Learning 
The first assignment of the class to get us used to the github workflow and give us space to reflect on chapter 1 of our book.

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
We manually wrote several basic statistical functions in c++ to compare to their built in r counterparts.

## Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models
Using r, we explored linear models. Namely Linear Regression and Classification. I worked with a partner to produce a 2 notebooks exploring these models on some sample data we found on the web.

## Portfolio Component 3: ML Algorithms from Scratch
We were tasked to perform Logistic Regression and Naive bayes on a specific dataset about titantic passengers. The target was if they would survive or die based on predictors age, sex, and passenger class. We had to build up the models from scratch in c++. We could not use a library with the algorithms already available or use r.

## Portfolio Component 4: Searching For Similarity
In this section we discussed machine learning algorithms that find similar observations and try to make connections by grouping them in some way. We discussed Knn, Decision Trees, Clustering, and Dimensionality reductions.

## Portfolio Component 5: Kernel and Ensemble Methods  
We explored Support Vector Machines for both Regression and Classfication using several kernels. Then we explored the utiltiy of ensemble methods using Random Forests, Bagging, and Boosting. Specifically highlighting the power of the algorithm XGBoost.
